            <h2>Our History</h2>
            <p>Started in 2010, Ristorante con Fusion quickly established itself as a culinary icon par excellence in
                Hong Kong. With its unique brand of world fusion cuisine that can be found nowhere else, it enjoys
                patronage from the A-list clientele in Hong Kong. Featuring four of the best three-star Michelin chefs
                in the world, you never know what will arrive on your plate the next time you visit us.</p>
            <p>The restaurant traces its humble beginnings to <em>The Frying Pan</em>, a successful chain started by our
                CEO, Mr. Peter Pan, that featured for the first time the world's best cuisines in a pan.</p>

            <h2>Corporate Leadership</h2>
            <h3>Peter Pan <small>Chief Epicurious Officer</small></h3>
            <p class="d-none d-sm-block">Our CEO, Peter, credits his hardworking East Asian immigrant parents who undertook the arduous journey to
                the shores of America with the intention of giving their children the best future. His mother's wizardy
                in the kitchen whipping up the tastiest dishes with whatever is available inexpensively at the
                supermarket, was his first inspiration to create the fusion cuisines for which <em>The Frying Pan</em>
                became well known. He brings his zeal for fusion cuisines to this restaurant, pioneering cross-cultural
                culinary connections.</p>
            <h3>Dhanasekaran Witherspoon <small>Chief Food Officer</small></h3>
            <p class="d-none d-sm-block">Our CFO, Danny, as he is affectionately referred to by his colleagues, comes from a long established
                family tradition in farming and produce. His experiences growing up on a farm in the Australian outback
                gave him great appreciation for varieties of food sources. As he puts it in his own words, <em>Everything
                    that runs, wins, and everything that stays, pays!</em></p>
            <h3>Agumbe Tang <small>Chief Taste Officer</small></h3>
            <p class="d-none d-sm-block">Blessed with the most discerning gustatory sense, Agumbe, our CTO, personally ensures that every dish
                that we serve meets his exacting tastes. Our chefs dread the tongue lashing that ensues if their dish
                does not meet his exacting standards. He lives by his motto, <em>You click only if you survive my
                    lick.</em></p>
            <h3>Alberto Somayya <small>Executive Chef</small></h3>
            <p class="d-none d-sm-block">Award winning three-star Michelin chef with wide International experience having worked closely with
                whos-who in the culinary world, he specializes in creating mouthwatering Indo-Italian fusion
                experiences. He says, <em>Put together the cuisines from the two craziest cultures, and you get a
                    winning hit! Amma Mia!</em></p>
